loading_screen_quotes_description_jiangshi_dynasty_feng	Yuwei Ha Feng was a student of magic expelled from the Celestial Institute of Astromancy in Wei Jin for dabbling in forbidden arts, as a scion of a noble dynasty his family sent their shamed son as a envoy to Lamhia from a long forgotten dynasty in the Nonchang basin. Centuries later he returned, neither living nor dead, he now serves a different much darker purpose. It is his charge to raise the armies of dynasties long past and inexorably march towards the unholy resurrection of Cathay for his master Harakhte.	true

The Dark Sorcerers working within the Tribunal of Night have perfected the art of raising sorcerers infused with the Lores of Yin and Dark, most are more dangerous in death than they were in life.	true
